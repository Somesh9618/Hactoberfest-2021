This was a problem that I personnaly solved in competitive programming competition.
I don't own the problem but the solution is mine. 

A string is good if strictly more than half of the characters in that string are "a"s.
For example "aaabb", "axaa" are good strings, and "baca", "awwwa", "" (empty string) are not.
You can erase some characters from the string s. And we would like to know what is the longest string remaining after erasing some characters (possibly zero) to get a good string. It is guaranteed that the string has at least one "a" in it, so the answer always exists.
